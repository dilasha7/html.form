    <h2> My school </h2>
    <p> My school's name is Kankai global Academy. It is located in Vyas 4 Damauli, Tanahun. It is very diffrent and unique compared to other schools in our town. Our school has a varitey if sports that everyone is allowed to take part in. Our school has a beautiful garden that can be seen when climbing up the stairs and a spacious basketball court near the classrooms. The environment that we are provided with at school is very welcoming and safe.</p>
    <p> Our school is filled with greenery and is filled with nature. Butterflies are never a rare sighting at our school. Our school is located on the very top of a hilly place. There are needed ammount of benches in every class and even though we dont have a lot of students, every class goes by smoothly and everyone stays entertained. The students at our school are all obligated to wear teh same uniform except on Tuesdays and Fridays. On those days we are asked to wear our sport uniforms.
        The view form our school is worth seeing. The whole town can be seen from the school and some of us can even spot our houses when looking out our classroom windows. Our school has a big school bus and makes two trips to pick up all students. Our classes start exactly at 10 and every class lasts almost an hour. Our school ends at exactly 4 and are fre to leave unless we have tution or evening assembly. Our school hosts morning assemblies only when the weather is favorable. If its raning or is too hot, we are asked bto sing the National Anthem and say our morning prayers in class. 
        Most of our teachers are still young whihc is what makes the classes more fun enjoyable. Jokes in are classes are never ending and absolutely halirous.</p>
    <p> In conclusion, I would like to conclusion this essay by saying that our school is very unique and absolutely worth studying in. Everyone should get a chance to visit our school atleast once in their lifetime. </p>
